# Mixin Hooks
Hooks are function that are called before and after  (bulk-) creation/updating/deletion and validation. Hooks can be added to you models in three ways:

1. By specifying them as options in `sequelize.define`
2. By calling `hook()` with a string and your hook handler function
3. By calling the function with the same name as the hook you want

```js
// Method 1
sequelize.define(name, { attributes }, {
  hooks: {
    beforeBulkCreate: function () {
      // can be a single function
    },
    beforeValidate: [
      function () {},
      function() {} // Or an array of several
    ]
  }
})

// Method 2
Model.hook('afterDestroy', function () {})

// Method 3
Model.afterBulkUpdate(function () {})
```

* [Sequelize#define](/Sequelize#define)
